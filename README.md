How to install
======
The Perl modules can be loaded directly into your FHEM installation:

```update all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RFD-FHEM/RFFHEM/master/controls_signalduino.txt```

Prepare your Arduino nano. Look at http://www.fhemwiki.de/wiki/Datei:Fhemduino_schematic.png
for hardware setup.


Connect the uC via USB to your FHEM Server and define the device with it's new port:

Example: ```define SDuino SIGNALduino /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0@57600```


You have to adapt this to your environment.
Connection via network is also possible.

If you made your setup with an Arduino, you can use this command to load the firmware on your device:

```set SDuino flash```

If this fails, you may need to install avrdude on your system.
On a raspberry pi it is done via

```sudo apt-get install avrdude```
