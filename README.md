How to install
======
The Perl modules can be loaded directly into your FHEM installation:

```update all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RFD-FHEM/RFFHEM/dev-r33/controls_signalduino.txt```

Prepare your Arduino nano. Look at http://www.fhemwiki.de/wiki/Datei:Fhemduino_schematic.png
for hardware setup.


Connect the Arduino via USB to your FHEM Server and define the device with it's new port:
Example: ```define SDuino SIGNALduino /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0@57600```
You have to adapt this to your environment.

If you made your setup with an Arduino Nano, you can use this command to load the firmware on your device:
set SDuino flash

If this fails, you may need to install avrdude on your system.
On a raspberry pi it is done via ```sudo apt-get install avrdude```
